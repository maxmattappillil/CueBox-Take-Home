# Assumptions and Decisions

- The "CB Constituent ID" is directly mapped from the "Patron ID" in the input data.
- The "CB Created At" is directly mapped to the "Date Entered" field. If a timestamp was not present in this column for a row of data, the default time is 00:00:00
- For determining "CB Constituent Type":
  * A record is marked as "Person" if any of these conditions are met:
    - Both First Name and Last Name are present
    - Title field is present
    - Gender is present and not "Unknown"
    - Tags contain "Student Scholar"
  * Otherwise, the record is marked as "Company". Also if the row contains only the "Patron ID" and "Date Entered" fields, it is assumed to be a company.

- For determining "CB Title":
  * If the "Title" column contains multiple titles separated by "and", the first title is selected.

- For determining "CB Email 1 and 2":
    - The primary email is assumed to be "CB Email 1".
    - The email CSV may not be in order by patron ID with the primary email being the first item per group, so this is handled accordingly.
